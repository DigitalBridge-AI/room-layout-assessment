# room-layout-assessment
Room layout assessment using the a Graph Neural Network and the Deep Support Vector Data Description loss. Code for the paper 'A One-Class Graph Neural Network for Room Layout Assessment' currently under review for ICML 2020.

Contact jacob.rawling@digitalbridge.com for comments and questions.

## Installation

The package can be installed by:

```shell
$ pip install -e .
```

The code has a dependency on DeepMind's [Graph Nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets).

The code was developed using python 3.5.2.

## Room Generation

Unfortunately we cannot release the code to place an furniture object into the room or completely generate a layout as these require commercially senstive proprietary software.
